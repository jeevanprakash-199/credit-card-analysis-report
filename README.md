# credit-card-analysis-report
Developed an interactive dashboard using transaction and customer data from a SQL database, to provide real-time insights.  Streamlined data processing &amp; analysis to monitor key performance metrics and trends.  Shared actionable insights with stakeholders based on dashboard findings to support decision-making processes.
This project involves the development of an interactive Credit Card Analytics Dashboard using SQL for data processing and Microsoft Power BI for data visualization and reporting. The dashboard aims to provide comprehensive insights into credit card performance, customer behavior, and transaction trends, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions.

Key Objectives:

To monitor and analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) related to credit card revenue, interest, and customer segments.
To understand transaction patterns and revenue generation across different credit card categories.
To gain insights into customer demographics (e.g., car ownership, education, job, age group) and their impact on revenue.
To track weekly performance and identify trends in transaction amounts and revenue.
Dashboard Components and Key Insights (as observed from the screenshots):

1. Credit Card Customer Report :

Overview KPIs: Displays "total revenue," "Total Interest," "Income," and "CSS" (likely a customer satisfaction or similar score).
Revenue By Week: A line chart showing the trend of revenue over time, likely on a weekly basis, indicating seasonality or growth.
Customer Job Distribution: A table showing the breakdown of "Customer Job" (e.g., white-collar, blue-collar, self-employed, others) against "Sum of REVENUE," "Sum of Total_Trans_Amt," and "Sum of Interest_Earned." This highlights which job segments contribute most to revenue and transactions.
Revenue by Income: A bar chart illustrating revenue distribution across different income brackets.
Revenue by Age Group: A bar chart showing revenue distribution across various age groups.
Car Owner & Revenue by Car Type: Visualizations indicating the relationship between car ownership, car type, and revenue.
Sum of REVENUE by state_cd: Likely a bar chart or similar showing revenue distribution by state code.
2. Credit Card Transaction Report 

Overview KPIs: Displays "Total revenue," "Total amount," "Total interest," and "Total transactions."
Credit_Category wise Data: A table showing "Credit_Category" (e.g., Gold, Platinum, Silver) with "Sum of REVENUE," "Sum of Total_Trans_Amt," and "Sum of Interest_Earned," providing insights into the performance of different card tiers.
QTR Revenue & Total Transactions: A bar chart comparing revenue and total transactions quarterly.
Revenue By Education: A bar chart showing revenue distribution based on the customer's education level.
Revenue By Job: A bar chart showing revenue distribution based on the customer's job type.
Revenue By Card Type & Chip: Visualizations likely showing revenue distribution based on different card types and whether the card has a chip.
3. Weekly Insights 

Weekly Performance Metrics: Displays "Total Transaction," "Previous Week Revenue," "Current Week Revenue," and "MOM Revenue" (Month-over-month revenue change).
Sum of Total_Trans_Amt by week number: A line or bar chart showing transaction amounts by week number, highlighting weekly transaction trends.
Revenue by Card_Category: A bar chart breaking down revenue by card category for the weekly period.
Response Summary (Likely survey or feedback data): A table showing percentages for "Delivered," "Responded," "Goal," "Self Reported," and "Total," potentially related to customer engagement or campaign response.
Technologies Used:

SQL (Structured Query Language): Used for data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) processes from source systems. This involves cleaning, aggregating, and preparing the raw credit card data for analysis.
Microsoft Power BI: Utilized for data modeling, creating interactive visualizations, designing the dashboard layout, and publishing the reports for end-users. Power BI's capabilities for drill-down, filtering, and cross-report interactions enhance the user experience and analytical depth.
This project empowers financial institutions or credit card companies to gain a holistic view of their business performance, identify opportunities for growth, optimize marketing strategies, and improve customer satisfaction.
